# Project Ideas

- Visualize velocity field of 2M TGAS sources 
- Run clustering on 6D phase space (kmeans to start, is there a fast way to do GMM where each datapoint has its own covariance matrix/distance metric?)
- Run clustering on 2D Gaia point sources (can we recover known sources with only single band imaging? Definitely some just visually!)
- Integrate and classify orbits of stars
- Search for metal-poor disk stars (Frebel, Yong, Roederer catalogs)
- Compute stellar parameters photometrically and compare to spectroscopic determinations
- Compare density of stars on and off the great MW plane
